* Procedural Map Generation
 * Currently there is only one map, we plan for maps to be generated fresh for each game creating a different map for each.
 * Difficulty: Medium


* Power-ups
 * We plan to add variety to gameplay be adding power ups. Examples of this would be the ability to place a wall somewhere, special ammo, or increased move distance.
 * Difficulty: Hard


* Clean up visuals
 * Currently loss of health and wall destruction is displayed for the client before they see the bullet impact that object. We plan to clean this up and have the update run on impact, not on shot.
 * Difficulty: Medium


* Add admin or overview page
 * We plan to add a page that would display number of active games/users as well as other interesting info on the current state of the server. This would most likely be restricted to admin access only.
 * Difficulty: Hard


* Restrict initial view of the map
 * At the beginning of the game the map will be partially obstructed. The player would have to move to different portions of the map in order to view whats there. This is sometimes referred to as the fog of war.
 * Difficulty: Hard


* Matchmaking
 * If a player does not have a group to play with a matchmaking option would be available where they will be placed into a lobby with other single players.
 * Difficulty: Hard


* Chat
 * Players should have an option to chat with other players they're currently playing with.
 * Difficulty: Easy

* Improve game UI
 * We plan to make a side bar with useful info like players names, health, color, available power-ups (when added), and other items. Along with this we want to add an actual floor texture, and other QOL effects like tread marks.
 * Difficulty: Medium
